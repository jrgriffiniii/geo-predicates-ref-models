# Samvera Geo Predicates Working Group
## Reference Linked Data Graphs and Models

Jump in: [![Slack Status](http://slack.samvera.org/badge.svg)](http://slack.samvera.org/)

The [Samvera Geo Predicates Working Group][1] is a body within the open source digital repository [Samvera Community][2].  This working group has been chartered in order to determine the best practices and recommendations for expressing geospatial repository assets as [linked data on the World Wide Web][3].  The [Resource Description Framework][4] is used to encode these linked data sets as semantic knowledge graphs.

This repository contains example knowledge graphs used for reference within the context of the efforts of the Working Group.  The structure of these graphs comply with the best practices and recommendations determined by the Working Group, and will be updated in response to any future relevant community efforts within this area of focus.

Within this, one may find graphs with documentation for persistence and querying using the following RDF stores:

* [Apache Jena Fuseki][5]
* [Virtuoso][6]
* [GraphDB][7]

Further, documentation outlining how these graphs may be generated using Samvera Gems are outlined for:
* [ActiveFedora][8]
* [ActiveTriples][9]
